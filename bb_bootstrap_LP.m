% no bias correction yet - although it should not change substantially 

% Inputs:
% Y which is the projected variable at horizon h. Length is T
% X is the matrix of regressor. Length is T
% nsimul = number of simulations, i.e. how many bootstrapped datasets to generate
% As block_size we use approximately half of the dataset
% CI is confidence interval. Say 95% for example

T                  = length(Y); 
q                  = size(X,2); 
l                  = ceil((T-q)^(1/3)); %quite arbitrary 

% need to do for every h
% there are (T-l+1) (1+q)-tuples
